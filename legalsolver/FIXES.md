# Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Legal Solver application.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Missing Templates**
   - Created the missing `login.html` template that was causing the application to crash

2. **Database Access**
   - Fixed the `get_document_by_id` function to use the correct table name (`document_history` instead of `documents`)
   - Updated document access in `download_document` and `view_analysis` functions to use dictionary access instead of index access

3. **JSON Handling**
   - Added proper JSON serialization in the `upload` function
   - Added JSON parsing in the `view_analysis` function
   - Updated `send_emails_for_analysis` to handle both JSON strings and objects

4. **File Upload**
   - Fixed the file upload form in `home.html` by changing the file input name from "file" to "document" to match what the upload route expects
   - Added a test script (`test_upload.py`) to verify file upload functionality

5. **Email Functionality**
   - Fixed the email sending process to correctly identify departments in analysis results
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose email sending issues
   - Ensured the `department_emails.json` file is created with default values if it doesn't exist
   - Added proper error handling for the email sending process
   - Fixed user_id retrieval to ensure it's always available for email sending
   - Improved error messages when emails can't be sent but departments are found
   - Added a dedicated error page to show which departments were identified when emails fail

## Security Improvements

1. **Email Credentials**
   - Updated email configuration to use hardcoded Hostinger credentials
   - Email: notification@agentsdistrict.com
   - SMTP Server: smtp.hostinger.com
   - SMTP Port: 465
   - Simplified email setup by removing environment variable requirements

## New Features

1. **Email Notification Dialog**
   - Implemented a dialog to show which departments received emails
   - Added confirmation of user acknowledgment email
   - Enhanced email error page with specific email configuration instructions
   - Updated email error page to provide Hostinger email setup guidance

2. **Documentation**
   - Created `README_EMAIL.md` with detailed instructions for setting up and using the email functionality
   - Added troubleshooting tips and security considerations
   - Added Hostinger-specific email configuration guidance

3. **Helper Scripts**
   - Created `run.py` script to start the application with email configuration check
   - Created `test_email.py` script to test the email functionality
   - Added `setup_hostinger_email.py` script for easy Hostinger email configuration

## How to Run the Application

1. Set up email credentials (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python set_env.py
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Testing Email Functionality

To test the email functionality:
```
python test_email.py
```

This will send test emails to the departments configured in `department_emails.json`.

## Email Configuration Setup

The application is pre-configured with Hostinger email credentials:

```
Email: notification@agentsdistrict.com
SMTP Server: smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP Port: 465
```

No additional setup is required to use the email functionality.

To test your email configuration:
```
python test_email.py
```
